## Full Tilt, a file templater and pre-processor

It's a little like Jekyll but a lot less opinionated.

#### How?
1. Put configuration variables in config.yml.
2. Make a template for each configuration file you want to generate.
3. Fill in the blanks with erb and salt to taste.
4. Generate all your files in one fell swoop.

        ruby bin/full_tilt.rb
